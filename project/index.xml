      <description>The two datasets I am using for this project contain information about nontropical bird species. One dataset (&amp;quot;nontropical_bird_data.csv&amp;quot;) came from a study performed at Michigan State University that compares characteristics from nontropical bird species. Such variables include scientific name, the number collected, latitude, diet type (from five categories), litter/clutch size, maximum longevity in years, and the seasonal variation in temperature. The second database came from a bird database website (birdlife.</description>

The main variables include fish sex, days since preservation, standard length, fork length, and weight. There are 1,008 observations in this data set.</description>
