As someone new to both R and python, it can get confusing knowing which syntax goes with which language. Or I'll learn how to do something really cool in R and have know idea how to get the same result in Python!

That's where reticulate comes in handy. This allows you to move back in forth between R and python.

#Allow me to demonstrate:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
riscool <- "I can use"
```
Here I've started with an R code chunk.

```{python}
pythonisalsocool = "reticulate"
print(r.riscool,pythonisalsocool)
```
And now I've put in a python code at well, stiched them together and, voila! We've just used R and python together!

Pretty cool, huh?
