      <description>As someone new to both R and python, it can get confusing knowing which syntax goes with which language. Or I&#39;ll learn how to do something really cool in R and have know idea how to get the same result in Python!
That&#39;s where reticulate comes in handy. This allows you to move back in forth between R and python.
Allow me to demonstrate: library(reticulate) riscool &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;I can use&amp;quot; Here I&#39;ve started with an R code chunk.</description>

      <description>Since we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, my roommates and I have been thinking a lot about air circulation. We got a CO2 monitor (since CO2 is a good proxy for how well the air is circulating in buildings) and we discovered that the CO2 in our house is pretty high! Not good! So we&#39;ve been opening up the windows a lot lately, but have struggled to find a good time to do so given Texas&#39;s unpredictable weather.</description>
